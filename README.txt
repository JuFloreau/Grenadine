This is a project for generative music with agents. 

Layout of the Grenadine repository :

* Ufo :
  max/MSP wrappers for algorithms.

* html :
  Doygen's documentation for pizAlgorithms.

* pizAlgorithms : 
  static library in C with, machine-learning, data 
  structures, and everything for the Grenadine project.

* Tralala :
  max/MSP GUI sequencer.

All that is "work in progress" : I don't care about backward compatibility.
