 * \details     A finite state automaton is :
 * \li          One value per node.
 * \li          Last value for each new sequence is a terminal state.
 * \li          Randomly, oldest first, nodes with same value are crossing-over, 
 *              lonely node for a given value are killed, 
 *              until the population is collapsed under the defined threshold.
 * \li          Terminal states increase the probability of playback head's jump.
